# Database case assignment (pair work)
Here is the case assignment for Databases and Data management course. This repository contains following files: assignment instructions, SQL-files, reports. 

The process started with analyzing the given instructions and other information. The first step within database development lifecycle was conceptual database design. It is a process to construct a high-level conceptual model of data requirements that are independent on all physical considerations. 

The next step was logical database design. At this point the conceptual schema was refined and translated into logical database structures. Entity and attribute type definitions were documented at this step.

The final phase of development lifecycle was physical database design. At this point, physical implementation of the database occured. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio was used for creating physical database.

DM_Case_DesignFinal pdf file contains the documentation of database development lifecycle while DM_Case_Closing_Report represents evaluation of overall project work and time spent for different development tasks.
